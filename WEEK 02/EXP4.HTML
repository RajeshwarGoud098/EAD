        <p>The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based web development framework for building modern web applications. It consists of four key technologies working together:

MongoDB (Database): MongoDB is a NoSQL document database used to store the application's data. It's flexible and scalable, ideal for handling large amounts of information.
ExpressJS (Backend Framework): ExpressJS is a NodeJS web application framework that provides tools for creating APIs and handling HTTP requests. It acts as the server-side logic of the application.
React (Frontend Library): React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs). It's used to create dynamic and interactive front-end components of the website that users interact with.
NodeJS (Runtime Environment): NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server. It's what powers the backend (ExpressJS) of the application.</p><br><br>
